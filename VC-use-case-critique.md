Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?

While Consent2Share utilizes a fairly straight forward implementation of GitHub’s version control, there are a few tools that it could better leverage to take full advantage of GitHub’s functionality. One of those is the transparency of comments when making changes to various versions of a document. For example, the User Guides are assumingly updated between each version (i.e. C2S Master Guide 3.4.0 is different than C2S Master Guide 3.3.0) however there are no details of what information was updated. Allowing users visibility into what update requests were made, and accepted, between various would provide more transparency to the overall version control process.
